{"abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of a methodology for the visualisation and hypothetical virtual reconstruction of Roman polychrome statuary for research purposes. The methodology is intended as an attempt to move beyond visualisations which are simply believable towards a more physically accurate approach. Accurate representations of polychrome statuary have great potential utility both as a means of illustrating existing interpretations and as a means of testing and revising developing hypotheses. The goal of this methodology is to propose a pipeline which incorporates a high degree of physical accuracy whilst also being practically applicable in a conventional archaeological research setting. The methodology is designed to allow the accurate visualisation of surviving objects and colourants as well as providing reliable methods for the hypothetical reconstruction of elements which no longer survive. The process proposed here is intended to limit the need for specialist recording equipment, utilising existing data and those data which can be collected using widely available technology. It is at present being implemented as part of the 'Statues in Context' project at Herculaneum and will be demonstrated here using the case study of a small area of the head of a painted female statue discovered at Herculaneum in 2006.", "authors": ["Gareth Beale", "Graeme Earl"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1","5","6","8","4"], "title": "A methodology for the physically accurate visualisation of roman polychrome statuary", "venue": "visual analytics science and technology", "year": 2011, "id": "2"}

{"abstract": "Learning research has argued the importance of providing authentic contexts for learning. However, traditional learning environments are often disconnected from external communities of practice. For example, students might design and carry out scientific experiments that are valuable pedagogically, but do not contribute to science itself. In this study, we used the Game Ontology Project (GOP), a wiki-enabled hierarchy of elements of gameplay used by games studies researchers, in a game design class. Students found it useful for learning. However, encouraging sustained participation was challenging because students tended to view the GOP as a static source, rather than a participatory and editable resource. Expert analysis of the student's contributions to the ontology found them to be useful and significant. We conclude with thoughts on the importance of these kinds of authentic environments in traditional learning.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Pablo Zagal", "Amy Bruckman"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["5","20","22","15","19","17"], "title": "The game ontology project: supporting learning while contributing authentically to game studies", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "id": "14"}
{"abstract": "The standard approach to calculating electrostatic forces and capacitances involves solving a surface integral equation of the first kind. However, discretizations of this problem lead to ill-conditioned linear systems and second-kind integral equations usually solve for the dipole density, which can not be directly related to electrostatic forces. This paper describes a second-kind equation for the monopole or charge density and investigates different discretization schemes for this integral formulation. Numerical experiments, using multipole accelerated matrix\u2013vector multiplications, demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new approach.", "authors": ["Johannes Tausch", "Jacob K.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach in automatic discourse segmentation without a full semantic understanding. In order to analyse the textual bonds and determine the degree of coherence that a discourse may exhibit, we first represent the tremendous diversity of textual relations into a discourse network. A set of mutual linguistic constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning among lexical items is encoded. Topic boundaries in a discourse are identified through a computational method which identifies the segment cluster from a higher order structure in the discourse network. Our segmentation is regarded as a process of identifying the shifts from one segment cluster to another. Experimental results show that our formulation is capable to address the topic shifts of texts. Comparison with a related method demonstrates that the combination of constraints is closely related, to the topic boundaries among textual segments. Evaluation using recall and precision shows the effectiveness of our approach in a collection of Chinese newswire articles.", "authors": ["Samuel W. K. Chan", "Benjamin K.

{"abstract": "Computer vision system is one of the newest approaches for human computer interaction. Recently, the direct use of our hands as natural input devices has shown promising progress. Toward this progress, we introduce a hand gesture recognition system in this study to recognize real time gesture in unconstrained environments. The system consists of three components: real time hand tracking, hand-tree construction, and hand gesture recognition. Our main contribution includes: (1) a simple way to represent the hand gesture after applying thinning algorithm to the image, and (2) using a model of complex-valued neural network (CVNN) for real-valued classification. We have tested our system to 26 different gestures to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that the classification ability of single-layered CVNN on unseen data is comparable to the conventional real-valued neural network (RVNN) having one hidden layer. Moreover, convergence of the CVNN is much faster than that of the RVNN in most cases.", "authors": ["Abdul Rahman Hafiz", "Md.

{"abstract": "Since the introduction of the ubiquitous computing vision by Mark Weiser, we observed quite some research from various R&D projects as well as groups that focused on different aspects in the area of context-awareness. However, there is yet no result which we can easily apply in a real environment. The context-aware service development and deployment process seldom focused on reusability and realistic implementation issues. We believe these issues can be tackled by proposing a complete context-aware system package. In this package both developers and users will be supported. This idea is realised at our department as a context-aware playground.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a purpose-based framework for support- ing privacy preserving access control policies and mechanisms. The mech- anism enforces access policy to data containing personally identifiable information. The key component of the framework is purpose involved access control models (PAC ) that provide full support for expressing highly complex privacy-related policies, taking into account features like purposes and conditions. A policy refers to an access right that a subject can have on an object, based on attribute predicates, obligation actions, and system conditions. Policy conflicting problems may arise when new access policies are generated. The structure of purpose involved access control policy is studied, and efficient conflict-checking algorithms are developed. Finally a discussion of our work in comparison with other access control and frameworks such as EPAL is presented.", "authors": ["Hua Wang", "Lili Sun", "Vijay Varadharajan"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["5","20","22","15","19","17"], "title": "Purpose-based access control policies and conflicting analysis", "venue": "information security", "year": 2010, "id": "28"}
{"abstract": "Much of the research and development effort in the IDS community is guided by a design approach, according to which user desires, expectations and agency are central. This approach may place unnecessary limitations on the design space. I argue for the validity and significance of an alternative, expressive approach, which may be more appealing to artists, and offer some formal parameters of IDS-as-Art. These open up for authors the ability to explore the creation of vastly complex and dynamic storyworlds that highlight contingency and probability; and the possibility of manipulating agency as subject matter to implicate users, through userly performance, in the storyworld's meaning. IDS can thus offer users an opportunity to reflect upon various aspects of their performance, including un- and subintentional aspects.", "authors": ["Noam Knoller"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["15","2","28","5","29","27"], "title": "The expressive space of IDS-as-Art", "venue": "international conference on interactive digital storytelling", "year": 2012, "id": "29"}
