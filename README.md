# DBLP-citation-network-prediction

This project helps prediction of DBLP citation network using LDA model.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Steps of project

<ol>
<li>Create DBLP citation network using graphs</li>
<li>Apply PageRank algorithm and sort nodes (choose a number of nodes)</li>
<li>For every node in top nodes, create the ego centric graph and then fusion these graphs in order to obtain the Ginf Graph</li>
<!-- <li>Create Ginf graph for every top nodes by aggregating the ego centric graphs of this top nodes </li> -->
<li>Apply LDA method</li>
</ol> 

## Usage

Open a Jupyter Notebook and import the file .ipynb
